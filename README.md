# poem-website
This is a Realtime poem website, where a user can come and log in and register himself and can perform basic CRUD operations
but right now it is an open page where anyone can come and add there poem and can see any other poem as well 
because i was not able to connect the login page to the website as i am doing it for the first time 
and i don't know why the css is not applying to the log in page, i designed it in such a beautiful way you can visit it and if possible pls help
